# Lesson One: Third-Party Narration Never Works

I think there's a few ways to drive a comic book story: dialog, monologue, or third-party narration, the voice of god.

The distinction between the three is probably what you're thinking: dialog-driven stories use conversation between characters, monologue-driven stories use "bubbles" to write out the thoughts of the main hero, and third-party narration uses "blocks" from the perspective of a nameless third-party.

The choice of which largely depends on the style of the writer – although the story itself can play a role as well. In _New Avengers_ (2004), there are just so many characters that there's little room for narration if each hero is to have their share of speaking bubbles. In a similar way, light-hearted characters like Spider-Man have little third-party narration, which tends to skew more "serious".

Maybe this is why I've read more Spider-Man than other character: I'm of the strong opinion that third-party narration is the worst of the bunch. I don't dislike serious comics – I've read 237+ issues of Daredevil, and as the saying goes "Spider-Man hopes, Captain American inspires, and Daredevil suffers." Rather, I'd say the issue is with the pseudo-philosophical tone third-party narration often takes on. Take the first page _Kang the Conquerer_ (2022):

Dramatic, over-the-top narration is certainly core to comic history, but for me, these kinds of blocks don't _quite_ land. Sure, they contribute a dramatic tone to the comic, but it feels like the writer is trying to get a "woah" moment out of us, and I just never really get there. For one reason or another, they always fall flat, and any immersion the comic would otherwise have peters away.

It's gotten to the point where, when starting a new series, I'll actually veto the run if the first issue has too much of this kind of narration. It's the not the absurdity of a god-narrator that bothers me – in fact, I think comics are at their best when they _embrace_ their absurdities – rather that it feels borderline inauthentic and bit dopey. Nobody wants to read a dopey comic.
