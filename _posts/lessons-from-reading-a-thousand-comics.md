I honestly think that doing that much of _anything_ is interesting. Of course you remember little – but the patterns you pick up, your intuition for what works and what doesn't, and the lessons you learn form a unique perspective that can only be gained by consuming so much of any one kind of content. If you'd like to skip the countless hours of reading and rely solely on my own conclusions, I'm happy to share my(:) Lessons from reading a thousand comics.

I have a lot to say on the topic of comics, so I think it makes the most sense to split this up into a few shorter blog posts. This is what I have for now, and as I publish new posts, I'll do my best to update the list:
