# Lessons From Reading a Thousand Comics: An Intro

All in all, I'm proud to say I've read 1,000+ comic books. In case you're curious, the (rough) lineup looks something like this:

1. **Spider-Man** (_679 issues_)
   - Amazing Spider-man #471-900 (_430 issues_)
   - Ultimate Spider-man (2000) #1-160 (_160 issues_)
   - Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man (2011) #1-28 (_28 issues_)
   - Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man (2014) #1-12 (_12 issues_)
   - Spider-Man (2016) #1-21, #234-240 (_28 issues_)
   - Miles Morales: Spider-Man (2018) #1-21 (_21 issues_)
1. **Daredevil** #413-649 (_237 issues_)
1. **Captain America** (2004) #1-71 (_71 issues_)
1. **X-Men** (_68 issues_)
   - New X-Men (2001) #114-133 (_20 issues_)
   - Astonishing X-Men (2004) #1-24 (_24 issues_)
   - Ultimate X-Men (2001) #1-13 (_24 issues_)
1. **New Avengers** (2004) #1-28 (_29 issues_)
1. **Ghost Rider** (2006) #1-35 (_25 issues_)

I honestly think that doing that much of _anything_ is interesting. Of course you remember little,Â but your form a perspective not so easily forgotten. You gain an intuition for what works and what doesn't, and you pick up patterns that can only be learned by consuming so much of any one genre. If you'd like to skip the >28,000 pages of comics and rely solely on my own conclusions, I'm happy to share my(:) Lessons From Reading a Thousand Comics.

I have a lot to say on the topic of comics, so I think I'll split this up into a few shorter blog posts. This is what I have for now, and as I publish new posts, I'll do my best to update the list:
