## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

<Info>
  __tl;dr:__ (malicious) Mallory tricks (victim) Victor into executing a
  malicious script on his own browser.
</Info>

Cross-site scripting is a bit of a misnomer - as the tl;dr suggests, Mallory's malicious script is running in _Victor's_ browser, there's little about the attack that's cross-site! So how can Mallory trick victor into executing her script? The key is a part of the app that injects unsanitized content from unknown sources directly into the DOM. Let's take a look at two examples:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/gifted-shape-473yzc"
  style={{
    width: "75%",
    height: 200,
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
    overflow: "hidden",
  }}
></iframe>

In the example above, we naively take the user input directly from the `input` element and insert it into the DOM by setting the `innerHTML` property of a given element. Without any sanitization, the browser interprets this input as it does any other text in our HTML file - as valid HTML.

To make the example more concrete, say the site determines the initial state of the input based on a url search param, `initialInput`, and Mallory sends Victor the following link:

`https://example.com?initialInput=%3Cscript%3E%2F%2F%20steal%20cookies%20and%20send%20them%20to%20Mallory's%20sever%3C%2Fscript%3E

Notice the `ininitialInput` search param has all those `%`'s - that's to make it URL safe. When Victor clicks on the link, the page will populate the `input` tag with the value of `initialInput` (i.e. the `script`), inject it into the DOM, and browser will execute it none the wiser. So what can we do?

### How to protect against XSS

1. First and foremost, escape any input from an untrusted source. This should include input the user directly interacts with, like an HTML `input` tag, as well as other forms of input like those found in the URL. If you're using a framework like `React`, any expression passed to `{}` will automatically be escaped and treated as plain text - not valid HTML for the browser to interpret.

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/naughty-waterfall-fs2c4c"
  style={{
    width: "75%",
    height: 200,
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
    overflow: "hidden",
  }}
></iframe>

<Info>
  The exception is when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, which bypasses this
  escape mechanism and executes directly in the browser. Use sparingly!

2. Implement a [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP). A CSP protects your app in a few ways:

- Specifies a white-list of `src` domains in `script` tags to be allowed to run by the browser
- Prevents _any_ other `script` tags from executing at all - including `script` tags inserted like those in our first codesandbox

I won't go into the syntax for the sake of brevity, but check out the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP#examples_common_use_cases) for some example CSPs!

### Non-script tag XSS attacks

Although we've focused up until now on XSS attacks based around injecting and executing a `script` tag, there's a few other important XSS attacks to be aware of:

1. Attacks through event handlers. In the following sandbox, we input a `img` with an invalid `src` property and an `onerror` event handler. When the `img` is inserted into the DOM and executed, the invalid `src` property will cause the `onerror` function to run, and just like that we have our XSS.

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/img-onerror-xss-4m7f5z"
  style={{
    width: "75%",
    height: 200,
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
    overflow: "hidden",
  }}
></iframe>
In other words, escaping `script` tags is not enough!

2. Attacks through bundled code. Our examples so far have all dealt with our victim, Victor, naively clicking a malicious link sent by Mallory. XSS attacks through bundled code, however, are due solely to the

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### tl;dr:

Mallory tricks Victor into sending a network request with his own session credentials in his own browser.
