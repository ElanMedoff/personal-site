I honestly think that doing that much of _anything_ is interesting. Of course you remember little of the details,Â but the overall perspective you form is not so easily forgotten. You gain an intuition for what works and what doesn't, and you pick up patterns that can only be learned by consuming so much of any one genre. If you'd like to skip the >28,000 pages of comics and rely solely on my own conclusions, I'm happy to share my(:) Lessons From Reading a Thousand Comics.

I have a lot to say on the topic of comics, so I think I'll split this up into a few shorter blog posts. This is what I have for now, and as I publish new posts, I'll do my best to update the list:

1. [Tie Together Smaller Arcs with an Overarching Story](/blog/tie-together-smaller-arcs)
