# A Barebones Approach to Continuous Integration

Of the many domains of software engineering, devops is one area I'm less familiar with. Since
shipping my blog and a few hobby sites, however, I've needed to pick up the basics in managing a
deploy process. In fact, I'd say my general lack of expertise makes me a great person to write on
the topic of minimalist CI setups - I know just enough to do what I need with nothing too fancy to
hold me back. I've done a good deal of trial and error, and I think this is a great approach for
small/medium sized projects.

This setup is a simplified version of the deploy process for my blog - a Next.js app - but the
fundamentals should apply to most projects.

## What is CI?

According to [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/):

> Continuous integration refers to the build and unit testing stages of the software release
> process. Every revision that is committed triggers an automated build and test. With continuous
> delivery, code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.

To achieve a simplified version of this, we'll create a `deploy.sh` script to run our test suites
locally, and on success, push our code to the server. In a `post-receive` hook on the server, we'll
execute a `post-receive.sh` script committed to the repo to rebuild the site for production.
Finally, we'll reload a pm2 daemon to run the Next.js server and make the updates accessible on the
web.

<Info>
  __Note__: Other approaches to CI frequently use a process that runs on a _remote_ machine, like
  Github actions or a Jenkins setup. These are great options for larger projects/companies, but in
  my opinion, a simple setup of running your build and tests locally before pushing to production
  works just fine.

## Pushing Changes to the Server with Git

Let's start at the second half of our continuous integration: pushing any updates to the server. For
this section, I'll defer to the following [article](https://toroid.org/git-website-howto). It's
great - I follow it step-by-step for every new project.

After reading through the article, you should be able to push new code to your server with something
like `git push server`, which will in turn trigger a `post-receive` hook - more on that below.

## Post-receive.sh

Like the article suggests, in my `post-receive` hook I check out the latest tree into my project
folder, but I also have a line to execute a separate `post-receive.sh` script checked into the repo.
See below:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
GIT_WORK_TREE=/var/www/[your project] git checkout -f
/bin/bash /var/www/[your project]/post-receive.sh
```

I'm a big fan of this approach, since it allows me to do the bulk of my work in a script that I can
manage locally. When I want to commit any changes, I just push it to the server like any other part
of my app.

In the `post-receive.sh` itself, I have:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
LOG=/home/[username]/[your project].log
DIR=/var/www/[your project]
NPM=/path/to/npm
PM2=/path/to/pm2

# overwrite file
echo "" > $LOG

cd $DIR || exit
echo "running npm install..." >> $LOG # append to file
$NPM install >> $LOG 2>&1 # redirect stderr to stdout
echo "ran npm install" >> $LOG

echo "rebuilding..." >> $LOG
$NPM run build >> $LOG 2>&1
echo "rebuilt" >> $LOG

echo "restarting pm2 daemon..." >> $LOG
$PM2 reload "npm run prod" --name blog >> $LOG 2>&1
echo "restarted pm2 daemon" >> $LOG
```

First, I define a few variables because, as explained in this
[stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35420236), the `PATH` when a git hook runs isn't
necessarily the same as when you ssh into a machine. I run `npm install`, since I don't check
`node_modules` into the repo (and you shouldn't either!), and run `npm run build` to build Next.js
for production. Finally, I reload the process running the Next.js server to use the updated code. To
manage my processes, I use [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/). As a tl;dr, with the command:

```bash
$PM2 reload "npm run prod" --name blog 2>&1
```

I'm telling pm2 to reload the process named `blog` by running the command `npm run prod` - and if
the process doesn't exist yet, `pm2` will create it for us.

I write to a log file before and after every step, and redirect any errors from each step itself to
`stdout` so they'll be recorded as well. To read from your log in real time, use `tail -f log.log`.

## Deploy.sh

That works great for the server, but to start everything off you'll need a local `deploy.sh` script
to run when you're ready to push new code. This script builds Next.js for production locally to make
sure nothing breaks when you run the same command on the server, and runs the e2es and unit tests.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "building locally..."
if npm run build; then
  echo "built locally"
else
  echo "build failed, aborting"
  exit
fi

# kill anything running on port 3000 so we can use it for e2es
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3000)
# start up a local pm2 daemon to run our e2es against
pm2 start "npm run start" --name e2e
echo "running e2es locally..."
if npm run test:e2e; then
  echo "ran e2es locally"
else
  echo "e2e tests failed, aborting"
  pm2 delete e2e
  exit
fi
pm2 delete e2e

if npm run test:unit; then
  echo "ran unit tests locally"
else
  echo "unit tests failed, aborting"
  exit
fi
```

If everything passes, you're ready to push to the server! You can either add the following code to
the `deploy.sh` script:

```bash
echo "input commit message >"
read COMMIT
git add -A
git commit -m "$COMMIT"
git push origin master
git push server
```

or move to a separate script entirely.

That's about it! A few daemons, a handful of bash scripts, and you have a simple yet effective CI
for your next side project.

dramatically.
