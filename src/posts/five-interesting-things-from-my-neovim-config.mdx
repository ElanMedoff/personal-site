# Five Interesting Things From my Neovim Config

Although I'm no expert in Neovim, I've found a few interesting solutions for the problems I've
encountered when switching from VSCode to Neovim. For those new and old to Neovim, I hope I can
provide some value as you tinker with your own config with the following interesting tidbits.

## 1. Absolute Imports in Lua

Importing another module into your Lua code can be a little confusing, to say the least. For
example, if you search how to import a module from a parent directory, you might come across this
[stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5761229/is-there-a-better-way-to-require-file-from-relative-path-in-lua)
with the following accepted answer:

```lua
package.path = package.path .. ";../?.lua"
```

For context, Lua keeps a list of semicolon-separated directories to search when resolving a
`require`, and stores it in a global variable called `package.path`. To import a module from a
parent, the solution above suggests updating the `package.path` to include the parent directory.

This works fine for importing directly from the parent directory, but you can imagine how poorly
this scales.

As it turns out, Lua in Neovim helps us out by automatically adding its own runtime path (i.e.
`~/.config/nvim/lua`) to the `package.path`! This means that with a filetree like so:

```txt
.
└── nvim/
    ├── lua/
    │   ├── settings/
    │   │   └── barbar.lua
    │   └── shared/
    │       └── helpers.lua
    └── init.lua
```

We can import the shared helpers in `helpers.lua` to our `barbar.lua` using the following code:

```lua
-- barbar.lua
local helpers = require("shared.helpers")
```

No need to manually update your `package.path`, and no need for relative imports either - just
include the entire path starting from `~/.config/nvim/lua`

## 2. Sending Neovim Keys Though iTerm2

When I first switched from VSCode to Neovim, one of the greatest pain points was relearning all the
shortcuts I became so used to: `cmd+s`, `cmd+p`, `cmd+z` etc. Unfortunately, as pointed out in this
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40991167) answer, you can only remap the `command` key
with MacVim (i.e. not NeoVim). Luckily, there's another alternative: using
[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/).

With iTerm2, you can set remaps with the `command` key that send arbitrary key inputs to the
terminal. In other words, you can set up a remap like `cmd+s` to send the key inputs `:w`! A few
gotchas to keep in mind:

1. The iTerm2 equivalent of `<cr>` is `\n`. This is mostly useful when submitting a Neovim command,
   like `:w\n`
2. To remap the `control` key, say `ctrl+x`, use the form `\<C-x>`

You can add remaps by going to iTerm2 -> Preferences -> Keys and clicking the `+` sign at the bottom
left. For the `action`, select _Send Text with "vim" Special Chars_, and you should be good to go!

## 3. Shared Settings For a Barebones Config

I've highlighted my motivations for periodically using a barebones config in
[this](/blog/sensible-vim-defaults) blog post, but I left out some implementation details on how
this fits into my overall Neovim config. Since nearly all of my options and a good chunk of my
remaps can be shared between a barebones and full-blown config, I decided to take advantage of the
overlap by sharing files between the two. Take a look at the following file structure:

```txt
.
└── nvim/
    ├── lua/
    │   ├── barebones/
    │   │   ├── init.lua
    │   │   ├── options.lua
    │   │   └── remaps.lua
    │   ├── settings/
    │   │   ├── plugins.lua
    │   │   ├── functions.lua
    │   │   ├── options.lua
    │   │   └── remaps.lua
    │   └── shared/
    │       ├── helpers.lua
    │       ├── options.lua
    │       └── remaps.lua
    └── init.lua
```

This file tree may look a bit weird, but hear me out. Ignoring the `barebones` directory, this is
just a normal Neovim config - an `init.lua` at the root, and some settings to import. In other
words, by default, I use the full-blown config's `init.lua` and settings. In the `barebones`
directory, I added a second `init.lua`, one which can be sourced with:

```bash
nvim -u ~/.config/nvim/lua/barebones/init.lua
```

Let's take a look at the two `init.lua`s

```lua
-- nvim/init.lua
package.path = package.path .. ";" .. os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.config/nvim/?.lua"
local h = require("shared.helpers")

-- remap leader before importing remaps that use it
h.map("", "<space>", "<nop>")
h.let.mapleader = " "

-- settings unique to the full-blown config
require("settings.plugins")
require("settings.functions")
require("settings.remaps")
require("settings.options")

require("shared.options")
require("shared.remaps")

```

and

```lua
-- nvim/lua/barebones/init.lua
package.path = package.path .. ";" .. os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.config/nvim/?.lua"
local h = require("shared.helpers")

-- remap leader before importing remaps that use it
h.map("", "<space>", "<nop>")
h.let.mapleader = " "

-- settings unique to the barbones config
require("barebones.options")
require("barebones.remaps")

require("shared.options")
require("shared.remaps")
```

Each config imports its own unique settings, along with the shared settings for both to use. It's a
setup I've come to really enjoy working with.

## 4. Remaps For Hard-to-Reach Keys

I've always had trouble hitting the keys on the top row of the keyboard, especially the pinkey-keys
to the right of `0`: `-`, `_`, `=`, `+`. To make these keys a bit easier to use, I have two types of
solutions: snippets and native Neovim remaps.

For snippets, I use [coc-snippets](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-snippets) with the following
`coc-settings.json`:

```json
// ~/.config/nvim/coc-settings.json
{
  "snippets.textmateSnippetsRoots": ["path/to/.config/nvim/snippets"]
}
```

This sources custom snippets from the `snippets` directory in the root of your config. I'm used to
writing VSCode-style snippets, so I use the textmate style with the following code:

```json
// ~/.config/nvim/snippets/misc.code-snippets
{
  "plus": {
    "prefix": "uu",
    "body": ["+"]
  }
}
```

This works wonders with using the `+` key, but snippets don't quite work for the other hard-to-reach
keys. Since snippets are triggered by a `prefix` like `hh`, the prefix must be separated from any
characters before it with a space. Unfortunately, there are many situations where you wouldn't want
a space before the character. Say we want to create a snippet for `=`, we can see that a trigger
prefix won't work for cases like `prop={prop}`. Instead, for `-`, `_`, and `=`, I use the following
native Neovim remaps:

```vim
inoremap <C-j> =
inoremap <C-k> -
inoremap <C-l> _
```

Personally, I've had great results with these two types of solutions, and I'd highly recommend
trying them out.

## 5. Search by Whole Word, Case Sensitive, or Both

One of my favorite search-related features in VSCode was the ability to search by whole word, case,
or both. Luckily, with the right keymappings, this isn't too hard to recreate in Neovim!

```vim
# case sensitive
noremap <leader>/c /\C<left><left>

# whole word
noremap <leader>/w /\<\><left><left>

# case sensitive and whole word
noremap <leader>cw /\<\>\C<left><left><left><left>
```

To replace multiple results in a single file, highlight your results with `/` or one of the commands
above, type `cgn`, enter the replacement, and press escape. Go to the next entry with `n` as normal,
and do the same replacement with `.`.
