# Implementing Dark Mode: A Server-Side Approach with Cookies

Last [article](/blog/dark-mode-client-side-approach), we talked about a `useDarkMode` hook designed
for client-only apps based on the local storage and media query APIs. Unfortunately, the approach
didn't scale with server-rendered content and introduced the potential for a flash between a light
theme rendered on the server and a dark theme re-rendered on the client. So for apps that initially
render their content on the server, how can we approach implementing a dark mode? The key is to
shift away from client-only APIs like local storage and media queries to server-and-client APIs like
cookies.

## tl;dr

```tsx
// pages/_app.tsx
import { createContext, Dispatch, SetStateAction, useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import App, { AppContext, AppInitialProps, AppProps } from "next/app";
import * as cookie from "cookie";

const ONE_YEAR = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365;

interface Theme {
  isDarkMode: boolean;
  setIsDarkMode: null | Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>;
}

export const ThemeContext = createContext<Theme>({
  isDarkMode: false,
  setIsDarkMode: null,
});

export function useDarkMode() {
  const { isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode } = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode as Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>] as const;
}

type AppOwnProps = {
  isDarkModeCookie: boolean;
};
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps, isDarkModeCookie }: AppProps & AppOwnProps) {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(isDarkModeCookie);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.cookie = cookie.serialize("isDarkMode", String(isDarkMode), {
      httpOnly: false,
      maxAge: ONE_YEAR,
      path: "/",
    });
  }, [isDarkMode]);

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode }}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

MyApp.getInitialProps = async (context: AppContext): Promise<AppOwnProps & AppInitialProps> => {
  const pageProps = await App.getInitialProps(context);
  const { req, res } = context.ctx;
  if (!req || !res) {
    return {
      ...pageProps,
      isDarkModeCookie: false,
    };
  }

  const isDarkModeCookie = cookie.parse(req.headers.cookie || "").isDarkMode as string | undefined;

  if (isDarkModeCookie === undefined) {
    res.setHeader(
      "Set-Cookie",
      cookie.serialize("isDarkMode", String(false), {
        httpOnly: false,
        maxAge: ONE_YEAR,
        path: "/",
      }),
    );
    return {
      ...pageProps,
      isDarkModeCookie: false,
    };
  }

  return {
    ...pageProps,
    isDarkModeCookie: isDarkModeCookie === "true",
  };
};
```

## Setting up Context

First, as a bit of setup, we'll need to create a context so we can use `isDarkMode` and
`setIsDarkMode` globally without passing the two through props.

```tsx
import { Dispatch, SetStateAction, createContext, useContext } from "react";

interface Theme {
  isDarkMode: boolean;
  setIsDarkMode: null | Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>;
}

export const ThemeContext = createContext<Theme>({
  isDarkMode: false,
  setIsDarkMode: null,
});

export function useDarkMode() {
  const { isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode } = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode as Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>] as const;
}
```

`useDarkMode` is a bit more ergonomic than `useContext`, and it also asserts that `setIsDarkMode`
isn't `null` - which in practice, it never will be.

While we _could_ wrap every page in the `pages` directory with a `<ThemeContext.Provider />`, it's
more ergonomic to write a custom `pages/_app.tsx` to handle this for us.

```tsx
// pages/_app.tsx
import { createContext, Dispatch, SetStateAction, useContext, useState } from "react";
import { AppProps } from "next/app";

interface Theme {
  isDarkMode: boolean;
  setIsDarkMode: null | Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>;
}

export const ThemeContext = createContext<Theme>({
  isDarkMode: false,
  setIsDarkMode: null,
});

export function useDarkMode() {
  const { isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode } = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode as Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>] as const;
}

type AppOwnProps = {
  isDarkModeCookie: boolean;
};
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps, isDarkModeCookie }: AppProps & AppOwnProps) {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(isDarkModeCookie);

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode }}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Looks good!

## Avoiding the White Flash with Cookies

Let's get back to our problem of solving the white flash.

Our cookie-based approach will go something like the following: on request, the user will
automatically send their cookies to the server. Before the server generates the initial HTML, it
checks to see if the user sent an `isDarkMode` cookie. If so, the server generates the initial HTML
with the theme considered. If there's no cookie, the server creates an `isDarkMode` cookie set to
`false`, generates the initial HTML with the default theme, and returns both to the user. On the
client, we'll create a `useEffect` to mutate the cookie when the global `setIsDarkMode` setter is
called so the theme is persisted on subsequent requests.

Just a heads up: since we're in the custom `pages/_app.tsx`, we can't use `getServerSideProps`.
However, we can use `getInitialProps`:

```tsx
// pages/_app.tsx
import { createContext, Dispatch, SetStateAction, useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import App, { AppContext, AppInitialProps, AppProps } from "next/app";
import * as cookie from "cookie";

const ONE_YEAR = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365;

// set up context

type AppOwnProps = {
  isDarkModeCookie: boolean;
};
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps, isDarkModeCookie }: AppProps & AppOwnProps) {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(isDarkModeCookie);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.cookie = cookie.serialize("isDarkMode", String(isDarkMode), {
      httpOnly: false,
      maxAge: ONE_YEAR,
      path: "/",
    });
  }, [isDarkMode]);

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode }}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

MyApp.getInitialProps = async (context: AppContext): Promise<AppOwnProps & AppInitialProps> => {
  const pageProps = await App.getInitialProps(context);
  const { req, res } = context.ctx;
  if (!req || !res) {
    return {
      ...pageProps,
      isDarkModeCookie: false,
    };
  }

  const isDarkModeCookie = cookie.parse(req.headers.cookie || "").isDarkMode as string | undefined;

  if (isDarkModeCookie === undefined) {
    res.setHeader(
      "Set-Cookie",
      cookie.serialize("isDarkMode", String(false), {
        httpOnly: false,
        maxAge: ONE_YEAR,
        path: "/",
      }),
    );
    return {
      ...pageProps,
      isDarkModeCookie: false,
    };
  }

  return {
    ...pageProps,
    isDarkModeCookie: isDarkModeCookie === "true",
  };
};
```

Let's walk through the code.

- First, we `await App.getInitialProps(context)` to get the props for the user's current page:
  `pageProps` - we'll need these for later when we merge the page's own props with our additional
  `isDarkModeCookie` prop.
- Next, we grab `req` and `res` from `context.ctx` and check if they're defined. This is a crucial
  check: although `getInitialProps` runs on the server during the first page load, it'll also run on
  the _client_ during client-side navigations! Thankfully, though, since client-side state is
  preserved during client-side transitions, `isDarkModeCookie` is effectively ignored when
  `getInitialProps` runs on the client since the `isDarkMode` state is already initialized with the
  instance of `isDarkModeCookie` returned from the first call on the server. Funky!
- To set the cookie, we set the `Set-Cookie` header using the
  [cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie) npm package. Although it's a little barebones, I
  decided to go with it since it has ~50 million weekly downloads, and it gets the job done
- `getInitialProps` returns the current page's props, along with `isDarkModeCookie`. In `MyApp`, we
  use `isDarkModeCookie` to initialize the `isDarkMode` state, and pass `isDarkMode` and
  `setIsDarkMode` down through context. In our app, we presumably use `useDarkMode` to access
  `isDarkMode`, and we render our app on the server with the preferred theme.
- Finally, we set up a `useEffect` so when `setIsDarkMode` is called, the `isDarkMode` cookie is set
  accordingly.

If the idiosyncrasies of `getInitialProps` are too much for you, I'll quickly outline an alternative
approach with `getServerSideProps`. Be warned though, every page in the `pages` directory will need
to be wrapped in context!

## Alternate approach with getServerSideProps

```tsx
// i.e. pages/blog.tsx
import { createContext, Dispatch, SetStateAction, useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import * as cookie from "cookie";
import { GetServerSideProps, InferGetServerSidePropsType } from "next";

const ONE_YEAR = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365;

interface Theme {
  isDarkMode: boolean;
  setIsDarkMode: null | Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>;
}

export const ThemeContext = createContext<Theme>({
  isDarkMode: false,
  setIsDarkMode: null,
});

export function useDarkMode() {
  const { isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode } = useContext(ThemeContext);

  // move the useEffect to useDarkMode to avoid repeating in each Page
  useEffect(() => {
    document.cookie = cookie.serialize("isDarkMode", String(isDarkMode), {
      httpOnly: false,
      maxAge: ONE_YEAR,
      path: "/",
    });
  }, [isDarkMode]);

  return [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode as Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>] as const;
}

export default function Blog({
  isDarkModeCookie,
}: InferGetServerSidePropsType<typeof getServerSideProps>) {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(isDarkModeCookie);

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode }}>{/* ... */}</ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

export const getServerSideProps = (async ({ req, res }) => {
  // no longer need to check that req and res are defined
  // since getServerSideProps only runs on the server!

  const isDarkModeCookie = cookie.parse(req.headers.cookie || "").isDarkMode as string | undefined;

  if (isDarkModeCookie === undefined) {
    res.setHeader(
      "Set-Cookie",
      cookie.serialize("isDarkMode", String(false), {
        httpOnly: false,
        maxAge: ONE_YEAR,
        path: "/",
      }),
    );
    return {
      props: {
        isDarkModeCookie: false,
      },
    };
  }

  return {
    props: {
      isDarkModeCookie: isDarkModeCookie === "true",
    },
  };
}) satisfies GetServerSideProps<{ isDarkModeCookie: boolean }>;
```

For most use-cases, this is where I'd stop. Our code will remember a theme preference across
requests, and generate server-rendered HTML for the user without a flash of the default theme.
However, there's one question left unanswered: what to do with a user's os-level theme preference.

## Bonus: Accounting For an OS-Level Theme Preference

Unfortunately, it's impossible to detect the user's os-level theme preference on the server for the
first request: it's only accessible on the client through a media query. What we can do, however, is
render the default theme on the first request, then set the os-level theme preference in the
`isDarkMode` cookie so that all _subsequent_ requests use the correct theme. However, if the user
manually changes their theme to be different than their os-level preference, we should respect that
as well. Let's update our code from above:

```tsx
// pages/_app.tsx
import { createContext, Dispatch, SetStateAction, useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import App, { AppContext, AppInitialProps, AppProps } from "next/app";
import * as cookie from "cookie";

interface Theme {
  isDarkMode: boolean;
  setIsDarkMode: null | Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean | null>>;
}

export const ThemeContext = createContext<Theme>({
  isDarkMode: false,
  setIsDarkMode: null,
});

type AppOwnProps = {
  isDarkModeCookie: boolean | null;
};
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps, isDarkModeCookie }: AppProps & AppOwnProps) {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(isDarkModeCookie);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isDarkMode === null) {
      const media = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)");

      document.cookie = cookie.serialize("isDarkMode", String(media.matches), {
        httpOnly: false,
        maxAge: ONE_YEAR,
        path: "/",
      });
      // don't call setIsDarkMode or you might have a flash!
      return;
    }

    document.cookie = cookie.serialize("isDarkMode", String(isDarkMode), {
      httpOnly: false,
      maxAge: ONE_YEAR,
      path: "/",
    });
  }, [isDarkMode, isDarkModeCookie]);

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider
      value={{
        isDarkMode: isDarkMode ?? false,
        setIsDarkMode,
      }}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

MyApp.getInitialProps = async (context: AppContext): Promise<AppOwnProps & AppInitialProps> => {
  const pageProps = await App.getInitialProps(context);
  const { req, res } = context.ctx;
  if (!req || !res) {
    return {
      ...pageProps,
      isDarkModeCookie: null,
    };
  }

  const isDarkModeCookie = cookie.parse(req.headers.cookie || "").isDarkMode as string | undefined;

  if (isDarkModeCookie === undefined) {
    return {
      ...pageProps,
      isDarkModeCookie: null,
    };
  }

  return {
    ...pageProps,
    isDarkModeCookie: isDarkModeCookie === "true",
  };
};
```

It's a bit more complicated! For our initial state, we use `isDarkModeCookie`, and update our state
to accept `null` values.

Let's consider the condition in the `useEffect`: If the `isDarkMode` state is `null`, there must be
no `isDarkModeCookie` set, which means this is the first time a user has visited the site. Let's use
a media query to check if the user has an os-level theme preference, and if they do, set the
`isDarkMode` cookie accordingly. Why not also call `setIsDarkMode` to match this preference? If
there was a mismatch between the default theme and the os-level theme preference, updating the state
would cause a rerender and create a flash - exactly what we're trying to avoid!

Instead, let's allow our state and cookie to be misaligned for just a little while. In fact, as soon
as the user directly sets the state with `setIsDarkMode`, `isDarkMode` won't be `null`, we'll skip
the `if` block, and we'll align the cookie and state once again.

I'll leave it up to you to decide if the improved user experience is worth the extra code
complexity. Thanks for reading!
