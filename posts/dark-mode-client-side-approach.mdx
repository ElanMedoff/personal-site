# Implementing Dark Mode: A Client-Side Approach

Implementing a dark theme for a web app is a deceptively difficult task. As a dev, you need to manage everything from media queries to local storage to cookies - all with a clear understanding of which rendering patterns support which APIs. In this article and the next, we'll talk through two different approaches to consider when building a dark mode in your next project.

First, we'll build a client-side implementation using media queries to access os-level preferences, and local storage to persist the chosen theme across reloads. The crux of this approach is to access our data _only_ on the client and render accordingly.

In the <Link href="/blog/dark-mode-server-side-approach">next article</Link>, we'll take a server-side approach, using cookies to store a client's chosen theme while ignoring any os-level preferences. Finally, in the second article's <Link href="">Bonus section</Link>, we'll discuss a hybrid approach to account for os-level preferences using both cookies _and_ media queries.

With that introduction out of the way, let's get started!

## tl;dr:

<Code language="tsx" code={`
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const key = "isDarkMode";
export default function useDarkMode() {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState<boolean>(() => {
    const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
    if (item !== null) {
      return JSON.parse(item);
    }

    const media = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)");
    return media.matches;
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(isDarkMode));
  }, [isDarkMode]);

  return [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] as const;
}
`} />

or the "safe" version to handle unexpected errors with `JSON` or `window.localStorage` methods:

<Code language="tsx" code={`
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const key = "isDarkMode";

const safelySetStorage = (valueToStore: unknown) => {
  try {
    window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(valueToStore));
  } catch {}
};

const safelyGetStorage = <T>() => {
  try {
    return JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem(key) || "null") as T | null;
  } catch {
    return null;
  }
};

export default function useDarkMode() {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState<boolean>(() => {
    const item = safelyGetStorage<boolean>();
    if (item !== null) {
      return item;
    }

    const media = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)");
    return media.matches;
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    safelySetStorage(isDarkMode);
  }, [isDarkMode]);

  return [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] as const;
}
`} />

## Nuances of the approach above

There's a few interesting behaviors the `useDarkMode` hook above implements that are worth pointing out.

First, it calculates the initial value of `isDarkMode` using a callback passed to `useState`. As explained in the updated [React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#parameters)

> If you pass a `function` as initialState, it will be treated as an _initializer_ function. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state. [...]

In our case, we want to determine the initial value of `isDarkMode` based on the value set in local storage or the result of the `"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"` media query. We first check local storage because if the user manually sets a theme, we should respect it regardless of the os-level preference - but let's dive a bit deeper into this.

Notice that in the `useEffect`, we synchronize the `isDarkMode` local storage with the `isDarkMode` state whenever the latter changes. However, since a `useEffect` runs after the first render, this means that the local storage will immediately be set with the value returned by the `useState` callback. In other words, our local storage will be set even if our code _does not call `setIsDarkMode`_! Are there any negative implications to this behavior? Maybe: the first time a user visits the site, if they have no os-level theme preference (or have a preference which matches the default theme), we'll immediately set the local storage to the default theme. If the user later sets/changes their os-level preference and revisits the site, our hook won't check for it, since the local storage is already set.

If you find this behavior undesirable, there's a few ways to prevent it.

1. Avoid synchronizing local storage with React state in a `useEffect`. Instead, write a custom `setIsDarkMode` function to set the state and local storage in one pass.

<Code language="tsx" code={`
export default function useDarkMode() {
  const [isDarkMode, _setIsDarkMode] = useState<boolean>(() => {
    // ...
  });

  const setIsDarkMode = useCallback(
    (valOrFunc: boolean | ((prevVal: boolean) => boolean)) => {
      const nextVal =
        typeof valOrFunc === "function" ? valOrFunc(isDarkMode) : valOrFunc;

      _setIsDarkMode(nextVal);
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(nextVal));
    },
    [isDarkMode]
  );

  return [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] as const;
}
`} />

2. Add a flag to prevent the `useEffect` from running on the first render.

<Code language="tsx" code={`
export default function useDarkMode() {
  // ...
  const isFirstRender = useRef(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isFirstRender.current) {
      isFirstRender.current = false;
      return;
    }

    // ...
  }, [isDarkMode]);

  return [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] as const;
}
`} />

<Info>
  Note that when wrapping your app with `<StrictMode />` in React 18, a
  `useEffect` will run twice on-mount in development, effectively negating our
  `isFirstRender` ref. Effects still only run once on-mount in production,
  though!
</Info>

I'll leave it up to the reader to decide if the simplicity of the original hook is worth the trade offs discussed.

## Pitfalls of this approach on the server

It's worth noting that our `useDarkMode` hook won't work as expected when rendered on the server, primarily because of the callback passed to `useState`. On the server, the rendering environment simply doesn't have access to the `window` object, and our hook will throw when we attempt to use the `localStorage` property on an `undefined` instance of `window`.

However, since a `useEffect` _only_ runs on the client, we would have no issues have accessing `window.localStorage` there - if only we didn't error-out on our initial render. Could we take advantage of the fact that `useEffect` only runs on the client and move the media query to the `useEffect` instead? We could, but that has its own trade offs:

<Code language="tsx" code={`
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const key = "isDarkMode";
export default function useDarkMode() {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState<boolean | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isDarkMode === null) {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      if (item !== null) {
        setIsDarkMode(JSON.parse(item));
        return;
      }

      const media = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)");
      setIsDarkMode(media.matches);
      return;
    }

    window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(isDarkMode));
  }, [isDarkMode]);

  return [isDarkMode ?? false, setIsDarkMode] as const;
}
`} />

Something like the hook above successfully accesses client-only APIs like local storage and media queries only when they're accessible, but at a heavy cost: when the hook runs on the server, `isDarkMode` is initialized to `false`, and the HTML for the first render is built accordingly. Later, on the client, if the `setIsDarkMode` is called in the `useEffect` with `true`, you'll have a flash between the light theme of the initial content and the dark theme of the app after the page is re-rendered with the new theme. Tricky!

So how can we prevent the dreaded flash? Keep reading in <Link href="/blog/dark-mode-server-side-approach">Implementing Dark Mode: A Server-Side Approach</Link>.
