<p>I think there&#x27;s a few ways to drive a comic book story: dialog, monologue, or third-party narration, the voice of god.</p>
<p>The distinction between the three is probably what you&#x27;re thinking: dialog-driven stories use conversation between characters, monologue-driven stories use &quot;bubbles&quot; to write out the thoughts of the main hero, and third-party narration uses &quot;blocks&quot; from the perspective of a nameless third-party.</p>
<p>The choice of which largely depends on the style of the writer – although the story itself can play a role as well. In <em>New Avengers</em> (2004), there are just so many characters that there&#x27;s little room for narration if each hero is to have their share of speaking bubbles. In a similar way, light-hearted characters like Spider-Man have little third-party narration, which tends to skew more &quot;serious&quot;.</p>
<p>Maybe this is why I&#x27;ve read more Spider-Man than other character: I&#x27;m of the strong opinion that third-party narration is the worst of the bunch. I don&#x27;t dislike serious comics – I&#x27;ve read 237+ issues of Daredevil, and as the saying goes &quot;Spider-Man hopes, Captain American inspires, and Daredevil suffers.&quot; Rather, I&#x27;d say the issue is with the pseudo-philosophical tone third-party narration often takes on. Take the first page <em>Kang the Conquerer</em> (2022):</p>

<p>Dramatic, over-the-top narration is certainly core to comic history, but for me, these kinds of blocks don&#x27;t <em>quite</em> land. Sure, they contribute a dramatic tone to the comic, but it feels like the writer is trying to get a &quot;woah&quot; moment out of us, and I just never really get there. For one reason or another, they always fall flat, and any immersion the comic would otherwise have peters away.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s gotten to the point where, when starting a new series, I&#x27;ll actually veto the run if the first issue has too much of this kind of narration. It&#x27;s the not the absurdity of a god-narrator that bothers me – in fact, I think comics are at their best when they <em>embrace</em> their absurdities – rather that it feels borderline inauthentic and bit dopey. Nobody wants to read a dopey comic.</p></div><div class="divider w-1/2"></div><div><p class="mb-3 italic text-sm text-primary">you may also like:</p><div class="max-w-[500px] cursor-pointer rounded-2xl flex items-center p-3 gap-3 border-base-100 border-2 hover:border-primary"><div class=""><h2 class="font-semibold mb-1">Lessons From Reading a Thousand Comics: An Intro</h2><p class="text-xs italic mb-2">July 27, 2022</p><p class="text-xs mb-2">An introduction to a new series on the lessons learned from 1,000+ comics.</p><div><span class="bg-secondary text-secondary-content rounded-full px-4 py-1 text-xs mr-1">comics</span><span class="bg-secondary text-secondary-content rounded-full px-4 py-1 text-xs mr-1">reading</span></div></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="flex justify-center py-4 text-xs border-t-base-300 border-t bg-base-100"><span>© elan medoff</span></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"content":"\n# Lesson One: Third-Party Narration Never Works\n\n\u003cdiv data-daisy=\"alert-info\"\u003e\n\n**Note**: this blog is part of a running series of the lessons I've learned from reading a thousand comics.
