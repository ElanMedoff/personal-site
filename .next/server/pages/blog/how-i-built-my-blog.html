<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of tech blogs. Compared to a video or dev talk, they&#x27;re often shorter, more intentional, quicker to skim when needed, and when dealing with difficult content, easier to review and re-read. They&#x27;re also fun to write – especially when most of your typing is coding. I&#x27;ve been wanting to write my own blog for some time now, and with a break in some of my other side-projects, I finally got around to it!</p>
<p>This post shouldn&#x27;t function as a step-by-step tutorial, but rather a high-level overview of the tech stack I use along with a few of my thoughts.</p>
<h2>Client</h2>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> as my front-end framework because of it&#x27;s optimization for static site generation. With SSG, every page is pre-rendered at build time and served to the user immediately. This is distinct from server side rendering, which renders the requested page at request-time. Since my blog renders the same content for every user, it makes a great use case for pre-rendering the site with SSG.</p>
<p>I looked into some other frameworks that specialize in SSG, but Next.js had the best combination of popularity – which goes hand-in-hand with online resources – and a good ratio of framework-specific quirks to features.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwindcss</a> as my CSS &quot;framework&quot;. I&#x27;ve experimented in the past with css-modules, plain scss, and <a href="https://vanilla-extract.style/">vanilla extract</a>, but I&#x27;ve found tailwind to be my favorite so far. Nothing can beat its dx.</p>
<p>Design isn&#x27;t my strong suit, so I decided to go with <a href="https://daisyui.com/">daisyui</a> as my component library. I mostly write my own components, but daisyui has some great color themes that I use too (the theme for this site is <code class="inline-block px-3 py-0 text-sm rounded bg-base-300">cyberpunk</code>!). Daisyui also has great integration with tailwind, so I can use classes like <code class="inline-block px-3 py-0 text-sm rounded bg-base-300">text-primary</code> to use the theme&#x27;s primary color instead of something like <code class="inline-block px-3 py-0 text-sm rounded bg-base-300">text-gray-200</code>. If I ever decide to add a dark mode in the future, this should make that <em>way</em> easier.</p>
<p>I write my blog posts in Markdown, which has an awesome syntax for writing, and some really nice default styles. I looked into using <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">mdx</a>, which has support for JSX components, but it seemed a bit overkill for my usecases. It&#x27;s a relatively new technology with a few kinks to work out (i.e. what to bundle when importing a component), so I think I&#x27;ll wait a bit.</p>
<p>For syntax highlighting in my code blocks, I use <a href="https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown">react-markdown</a> and the approach outlined <a href="https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use-custom-components-syntax-highlight">here</a>. It was a bit of a pain to set up, but it&#x27;s the best solution I&#x27;ve found so far.</p>
<p>When I want to apply tailwind or daisyui styles to my markdown, I&#x27;ve found it easiest to wrap the section in a <code class="inline-block px-3 py-0 text-sm rounded bg-base-300">div</code> with a custom attribute. I just select for that attribute in my s/css, and it applies the styles as expected. For instance, I&#x27;ll import the following scss into the component where I parse my markdown:</p>
<pre><div style="color:#a9b7c6;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, monospace;direction:ltr;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;padding:1em;margin:.5em 0;overflow:auto;background:#2b2b2b"><code class="language-scss" style="color:#a9b7c6;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, monospace;direction:ltr;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none"><span class="token" style="color:#cc7832">[data-daisy=&quot;alert-info&quot;] </span><span class="token" style="color:#a9b7c6">{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span class="token rule" style="color:#cc7832">@apply</span><span class="token" style="color:#cc7832"> alert alert-info shadow-lg my-6</span><span class="token" style="color:#a9b7c6">;</span><span class="token" style="color:#cc7832">
</span><span class="token" style="color:#cc7832">
</span><span class="token" style="color:#cc7832">  &amp; a</span><span> </span><span class="token" style="color:#a9b7c6">{</span><span>
</span><span>    @apply text-secondary-content </span><span class="token" style="color:#9876aa">hover</span><span class="token" style="color:#a9b7c6">:</span><span>text-accent-focus</span><span class="token" style="color:#a9b7c6">;</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span class="token" style="color:#a9b7c6">}</span><span>
</span><span></span><span class="token" style="color:#a9b7c6">}</span></code></div></pre>
<p>It&#x27;s a little hacky, but it works well for me.</p>
<h3>Atropos</h3>
<p>For the fancy 3D parallax image on the homepage, I use <a href="https://atroposjs.com/">Atropos</a>. The library is surprisingly minimal, and the documentation bare-bones, so I&#x27;ve had to reverse engineer a few of features I wanted from the examples on their site. This blog is <a href="https://github.com/ElanMedoff/personal-site">open source</a>, so maybe I can save you from doing the same!</p>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>On the server side of things, I host my blog on a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">digital ocean</a> droplet – the cheapest one available. I use <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">nginx</a> as a proxy for my Next.js server, and <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot</a> to set up my ssl certificate.</p>
<p>To manage my production code, I use <a href="https://toroid.org/git-website-howto">this setup</a> to push changes to the server with the command <code class="inline-block px-3 py-0 text-sm rounded bg-base-300">git push server</code>. It&#x27;s bare-bones, low-level, and awesome.</p>
<p>For my <em>very</em> basic continuous integration, I wrote the following deploy script:</p>
<pre><div style="color:#a9b7c6;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, monospace;direction:ltr;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;padding:1em;margin:.5em 0;overflow:auto;background:#2b2b2b"><code class="language-bash" style="color:#a9b7c6;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, monospace;direction:ltr;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none"><span class="token shebang" style="color:#cc7832">#!/bin/bash</span><span>
</span><span></span><span class="token" style="color:#ffc66d">npm</span><span> run build
</span><span></span><span class="token" style="color:#ffc66d">git</span><span> </span><span class="token" style="color:#ffc66d">add</span><span> -A
</span><span></span><span class="token" style="color:#ffc66d">git</span><span> commit -m </span><span class="token" style="color:#6a8759">&quot;</span><span class="token" style="color:#9876aa">$1</span><span class="token" style="color:#6a8759">&quot;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span class="token" style="color:#ffc66d">git</span><span> push origin master
</span><span></span><span class="token" style="color:#ffc66d">git</span><span> push server</span></code></div></pre>
<p>Notice that I run the build step locally instead of on the server – my $4 droplet didn&#x27;t have the power to build the site itself :( This clutters the github repo and slows down pushes, but it works fine for now.</p>
<p>I use a systemd service to run my Next.js server, and I restart the service automatically when new code is pushed – it took just one line added to the post-receive hook:</p>
<pre><div style="color:#a9b7c6;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, monospace;direction:ltr;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;padding:1em;margin:.5em 0;overflow:auto;background:#2b2b2b"><code class="language-text" style="color:#a9b7c6;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, monospace;direction:ltr;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none"><span>sudo systemctl restart next</span></code></div></pre>
<p>I&#x27;ll write a full post on my minimal approach to continuous integration, but this should do for now.</p>
