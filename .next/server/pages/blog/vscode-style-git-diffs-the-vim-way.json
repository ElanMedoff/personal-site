Nowhere is this more true than when viewing git diffs. In VSCode, you have an elegant interface in the sidebar that shows every change since your last commit as a side-by-side diff. It also has other nice features, like the option to the discard all the changes in a particular file.\n\nBefore I switched to Vim, using this feature was an essential part of my workflow. I'd make a few changes, check the diffs to make sure I got rid of my TODOS, and pushed. It was great.\n\nUnfortunately, it takes a little more work to get something analogous working for Vim.\n\n## My Homegrown Solution\n\nThe solution I stitched together prioritizes moving quickly from file to file, sacrificing the fancier features of VSCode for a low-level approach. In fact, it can be boiled down to just the following bash function:\n\n```bash\ngd () {\n\tnvim -p $(git diff --name-only) -c \":tabdo :Gvdiffsplit\"\n}\n```\n\nLet's walk through it chunk by chunk.\n\nFirst, the `-p` flag. If we enter `nvim --help` in the terminal, we can see the following:\n\n```text\n-p[N]                 Open N tab pages (default: one per file)\n```\n\nIn our case, we're using the result of `$(git diff --name-only)` as our `[N]` to determine how many tabs to open in Vim. Looking at the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff), we can see that the `--name-only` flag returns the names of the changed files. In other words, open one tab for each changed file.\n\nWith the same `nvim --help` command, we can see that the `-c` flag executes its argument as a Vim command:\n\n```text\n-c <cmd>      Execute <cmd> after config and first file\n```\n\nIn our case, the command we're passing to the `-c` flag is `:tabdo :Gvdiffsplit`.\n\nWhile in Vim, we can enter the command `:help :tabdo` to get the following info on `:tabdo`:\n\n```text\n:[range]tabd[o] {cmd}\n  Execute {cmd} in each tab page ...\n```\n\nThe command we're passing to `:tabdo` is `:Gvdiffsplit`, which is from the plugin [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive). You can install vim-fugitive with the package-manager of your choice.\n\nIn the github documentation for vim-fugitive, we can see the following info on `:Gvdiffsplit`:\n\n```text\n:Gdiffsplit (or :Gvdiffsplit) brings up the staged version of the file side by side with the working tree version.\n```\n\nPutting everything together, our `gd` bash function opens a tab for every changed file, and for each tab, opens up a side-by-side git diff.\n\nThis homegrown function lacks some of the fancier capabilities of VSCode, but navigating forward is _fast_. To go from one file to the next, simply exit twice, once for each split! You can even setup a keybinding to make it that much faster.\n\n```vim\nnnoremap gn :q<cr>:q<cr>\n```\n\nThis function is perfect for taking a last look at your changes before committing.\n\n## Bonus: diffview.nvim\n\nIf you're interested in a more batteries-included solution, I'd recommend checking out [diffview.nvim](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim). Just like in VSCode, you can view side-by-side diffs of all the files changes since your last commit, with a whole bunch of other bells and whistles.
